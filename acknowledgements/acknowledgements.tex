I am deeply thankful to my supervisor, Prof. Leo Joskowicz, for his sincere care and commitment along the entire PhD, for his technical guidance, and for providing financial support.

I wish to heartily thank Eyal Lin and Ronen Shter of GE Healthecare Haifa, whose expertise, generosity and cooperation in providing access to their facilities, and specifically access to CT sinogram data from phantom scans, has given me the otherwise unattainable resources to validate the methods presented in this thesis.

I also wish to thank my family and friends for their support throughout the long journey toward the PhD. I thank my colleagues at the CASMIP laboratory and at the Hebrew University for helpful discussions, new ideas, and also for their company in much needed breaks from research.
